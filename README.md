# Smart-Crop-Monitoring-System
Smart Crop Monitoring System uses IoT sensors and ML models to optimize farming. It collects real-time data (temperature, humidity, NPK), predicts soil moisture, and recommends fertilizers. Data is visualized on a ThingsBoard dashboard, enabling informed decisions for better yields and sustainable agriculture. Built with Python and MQTT.
